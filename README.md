*Current RMMBY Core Version: 0.6.1*

RMMBY is a Unity Mono mod manager originally designed for RWBY: Arrowfell

# Using RMMBY
One of the goals of RMMBY is being easy to add to other Unity Mono games. To add RMMBY to a new game, it just requires some simple edits to the two scripts found in RMMBY.Editable.

RMMBY does require [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/).

The RMMBY in-game mod menu is also customizable for every game (although limited in the current early access state). You can download RWBY: Arrowfell example Unity project, and edit it to fit your game. Some options, such as button positions and scroll limits, will be editable via the data file in the future, but currently requires editing some variables in ModMenuHandler found in RMMBY Core.

The source code contains code specific to RWBY: Arrowfell as an example

[Read the wiki](https://github.com/Makarew/RMMBY/wiki) to find out how to add RMMBY to a new game.
